# Marathon Runners Data Analysis Project

This project explores a dataset containing information about marathon runners from around the globe. The dataset was analyzed to gain insights into various aspects of marathon running, including demographics, performance metrics, and trends.

## Overview

The dataset used in this project contains the following fields:

- **Year of Event:** The year when the marathon event took place
- **Event Dates:** Dates of the marathon event
- **Event Name:** Name of the marathon event
- **Event Distance/Length:** Length of the marathon event (e.g., full marathon, half marathon)
- **Event Number of Finishers:** Total number of participants who completed the marathon
- **Athlete Performance:** Finishing time of the athlete in the marathon
- **Athlete Club:** Club affiliation of the athlete (if applicable)
- **Athlete Country:** Nationality of the athlete
- **Athlete Year of Birth:** Birth year of the athlete
- **Athlete Gender:** Gender of the athlete (Male/Female)
- **Athlete Age:** Age of the athlete
- **Athlete Category:** Category of the athlete (if applicable)
- **Athlete Average Speed:** Average speed of the athlete during the marathon
- **Athlete ID:** Unique identifier for each athlete

The project follows a standard data analysis process, including data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning:** The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, incorrect data types, and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Various exploratory analyses were performed to understand the distribution of runners based on age, gender, nationality, and performance metrics. This helped identify patterns and trends within the data.
3. **Data Visualization:** Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts were used to effectively communicate the insights gained from the data.
4. **Summary Statistics:** Key summary statistics were calculated to provide a concise overview of the dataset.

## Tools Used

- Python programming language
- Pandas library for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization

## Files

- `TWO_CENTURIES_OF_UM_RACES.csv`: The raw dataset used for analysis
- `Marathon EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis

## Conclusion

Through this analysis, several insights were gained regarding marathon runners' demographics and performance. These insights can be valuable for event organizers, sponsors, and participants alike.

## Future Work

Potential areas for further exploration include:

- Correlation analysis between age, gender, and performance
- Comparison of performance metrics across different marathon events and distances
- Predictive modeling to forecast future marathon performance based on demographic factors
